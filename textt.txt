In MySQL, the FOREIGN KEY keyword is used to define a foreign key constraint in a table, which creates a link between two tables based on the values of one or more columns. This relationship ensures that the value in the foreign key column in one table corresponds to a value in the primary key column of another table, helping to maintain data integrity.

Steps to Use Foreign Key in MySQL
Create the Parent Table: This is the table that contains the primary key.

Create the Child Table: This table will contain the foreign key that references the primary key of the parent table.

Define the Foreign Key Constraint: When creating the child table, you will specify the foreign key column and the corresponding parent table and column.

Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how to use foreign keys in MySQL:

Step 1: Create the Parent Table
 
CREATE TABLE department (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);
Step 2: Create the Child Table
 
CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES department(dept_id)
);
Explanation:
Parent Table (department):
Contains dept_id as the primary key.
Child Table (employee):
Contains emp_id as the primary key.
Contains dept_id which acts as a foreign key referencing dept_id in the department table.
Additional Notes:
Data Integrity: The foreign key constraint ensures that any value of dept_id in the employee table must exist in the department table. If you try to insert a record into the employee table with a dept_id that does not exist in the department table, MySQL will return an error.

Cascading Options: You can specify additional options like ON DELETE CASCADE or ON UPDATE CASCADE to automatically delete or update records in the child table when the corresponding record in the parent table is deleted or updated. Example:

 
FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES department(dept_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE
Creating Foreign Keys After Table Creation: You can also add foreign key constraints after the tables have been created using the ALTER TABLE statement:

 
ALTER TABLE employee
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department
FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES department(dept_id);
Example Usage
You can insert data into the department table first, and then use the foreign key to maintain relationships in the employee table:

 
INSERT INTO department (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES (1, 'HR'), (2, 'Sales');

INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 1), (2, 'Bob', 2);
This setup ensures that each employee is linked to a valid department, maintaining the integrity of your database.

DDL (Data Definition Language) Commands
DDL commands are used to define or modify the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, or schemas. Common DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE.

CREATE
Syntax:

 
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name1 data_type constraints,
    column_name2 data_type constraints,
    ...
);
Description: Creates a new table or database object.

Example:

 
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
ALTER
Syntax:

 
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name data_type;  -- To add a new column

ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name data_type;  -- To modify an existing column

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;  -- To drop a column
Description: Modifies an existing table by adding, modifying, or deleting columns.

Example:

 
ALTER TABLE students
ADD email VARCHAR(100);
DROP
Syntax:

 
DROP TABLE table_name;
Description: Deletes an existing table and its structure from the database.

Example:

 
DROP TABLE students;
TRUNCATE
Syntax:

 
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
Description: Removes all rows from a table, but keeps the table structure.

Example:

 
TRUNCATE TABLE students;
DML (Data Manipulation Language) Commands
DML commands are used for managing data within tables. Common DML commands include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

INSERT
Syntax:

 
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
Description: Inserts data into a table.

Example:

 
INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20);
UPDATE
Syntax:

 
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
Description: Updates existing records in a table.

Example:

 
UPDATE students
SET age = 21
WHERE student_id = 1;
DELETE
Syntax:

 
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Description: Deletes records from a table.

Example:

 
DELETE FROM students
WHERE student_id = 1;
DQL (Data Query Language) Command
DQL is primarily used for querying data from the database. It includes only the SELECT command.

SELECT
Syntax:

 
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Description: Retrieves data from a database table.

Example:

 
SELECT name, age
FROM students
WHERE age > 18;
